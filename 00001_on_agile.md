# On Agile  

Agile. If you've worked in software even peripherally you'll likely have heard of it. If you're a developer, odds are you're already rolling your eyes and instinctively moving to close the tab. I know, I know... but bear with me here. While it certainly isn't the be-all and end-all of software development that it's purported to be by the folks over at BCG, KPMG, and McKinsey, there are still useful aspects to the ideas behind it. As with any set of principles of practices in software, the aim should be to find the useful components and leverage them while tossing out everything else that doesn't work for you and for your team.  

## What **IS** Agile?  

Let's first talk about what Agile is and what it isn't.  

**Agile is a buzzword**.  

**Agile is not new**.  

**Agile is not a silver bullet**. It's not the solution to all of the SDLC's problems, nor is it the cause of them. It's a [set of principles](https://agilemanifesto.org/) that outline a way of *thinking about how software is built*. A company can't "become Agile" overnight - [if it can at all](#agile-transitions-dont-work) - and any significant change to team dynamics, structure, or processes will almost certainly result in *decreased* productivity in the short term.  

**Agile is not Scrum**. It's very common to see them conflated, but the best Agile teams are not Scrum teams. Or at least, they don't follow all the rituals of core Scrum. No single component of Scrum is necessary to run an Agile team; it is a framework that attempts to apply the principles defined in the manifesto. [More on this later](#scrum-kind-of-sucks).  


## Cargo Cult Agile  



### "Doing" Agile versus "Being" Agile  


## Agile transitions don't work  

Depeding on who you ask, anywhere from [47%](https://scruminc.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Why-47-of-Agile-Transformations-Fail.pdf) (in a shocking twist, Jeff Sutherland is on the optimistic end of the spectrum!) to [a whopping 96%](https://www.netsolutions.com/insights/how-to-prevent-agile-transformation-failure/) of Agile transformations fail. Partly, this is just a [software development problem]()  

Every so often - typically when a recently-hired executive is keen to make their mark in the new role - a company will jump the shark and "adopt Agile". This usually involves bringing in highly-paid consultants for a few weeks, paying the Scrum Alliance an exorbitant amount of money for training, and changing a few titles around. Project Managers are now Scrum Masters, Product Managers are now Product Owners, teams are now Scrum Teams. These efforts are doomed from the start, and most of the people involved know it. But the money is sacrificed to the budget gods in the hopes of a bountiful harvest next quarter regardless.  

So what gives? What are companies hoping to gain by rolling this boulder up the hill?  




The way an organization is structured is extremely important when trying to make Agile teams work. It's [Conway's Law](https://www.melconway.com/Home/Conways_Law.html):  

> *Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization's communication structure.*  


### Effecting change in large organizations  

The challenge is, more often than not your team's bottlenecks will be the same.  

## Scrum kind of sucks  

Scrum is a big part of why many developers roll their eyes and groan when they hear the word "Agile".  

### What makes a Scrum team  

### The problem with standups  

### Backlogs, refinement, and staying on course  

### Retrospectives are hard  

### What about Kanban?  

<!-- Talk about the Phoenix Project? -->

<!-- Read up on Vanguard's journey from Scrum to Kanban -->


## Scaled Agile is a joke  


## The "Agile developer" myth  

There is no such thing as an "Agile developer".  

### Finding your rhythym  

So what's a lowly IC to do?  


## Agile requires buy-in  

If companies want their teams to succeed, there has to be buy-in from the top down. Leadership must understand and extol the virtues of Agile practices. They must understand that team productivity may fluctuate as teams adapt to new ways of working. And they must traditional success metrics in favour of focusing on incremental improvement.  


## Agile is hard to measure  

### The velocity trap
